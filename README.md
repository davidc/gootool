### Current status

This is currently a copy of the SVN repository as of September 2012. The branch 1.0.4-dev is only minor updates from the last released
version. The trunk contains a lot of unreleased development work that separates out "target" worlds that are built (this was done to
allow for remote targets over SFTP, e.g. on iOS). I believe this is working but it involved a rewrite of a large chunk of the core
code and it has not had substantial testing as yet.
