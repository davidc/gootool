MILESTONE 1.0.0 (First public release)

- A new Source and Target abstraction for reading source game files and writing output.
- Implementations: local (disk input, disk output), iphone (zip input, scp output)
- Output should be cached and not flush until a final flush call
- Reads from the output should read the cached version rather than the disk version (e.g. when modifying text.xml repeatedly on addin installation)
- This will also allow for "abort build" which simply never flushes, and resets the Target

sp level editor needs to loads balls (resources, etc) from a custom resource manager that ONLY includes:
- main game files
- additional and modified files from dependent addins
- files within this mod itself
