World of Goo Volume Control v1.0

This is a simple hack to allow the game volume to be controlled, either by
clicking on the volume icon in the notification area, or by using the global
hotkeys.

Please note that this is an unoffical and completely unsupported hack. There is
absolutely no guarantee that this will work on your computer.

To install:
    Find your World of Goo installation directory (usually something like
    C:\Program Files\2D Boy\World of Goo) and then:
     - rename "irrKlang.dll" to "RealIrrKlang.dll" (this is required!)
     - copy the hacked "irrKlang.dll" in its place

To uninstall:
    First ensure that you still have the "RealIrrKlang.dll" file, then:
     - delete the hacked "irrKlang.dll"
     - rename "RealIrrKlang.dll" back to "irrKlang.dll"

Hotkeys:

    Ctrl O/-        Decrease sound volume
    Ctrl P/+        Increase sound volume
    Ctrl M          Toggle sound mute
    
    Alt O/-         Decrease music volume
    Alt P/+         Increase music volume
    Alt M           Toggle music mute

    Ctrl Alt O/-    Decrease both sound and music volume
    Ctrl Alt P/+    Increase both sound and music volume
    Ctrl Alt M      Toggle both sound and music mute
