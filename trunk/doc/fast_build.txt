Target loops through all files and compares them with the source contents:

- If missing in source, mark REMOVE
- If different in source, mark RESTORE

Then loop through source to find any remaining files that are in source and not target.

- Mark any missing files as RESTORE

Process all the addins to get a list of all the files they affect.
Update the list of files with a list of all addins (with ID and version) that should affect it. Order is important.

Load the "last saved" state.txt from the target directory.
This stores the filenames along with the list of affecting addins for each (same as above).

For each file in the list:

If the list of affecting addins in the target directory equals the list of affecting addins we are
about to apply anyway, remove the file from the list of files to process.

Any files remaining, do the following:

- If marked REMOVE, remove the file
- If marked RESTORE, restore the file

Then, for each addin that affects this file, run its merge, compile or override rule.
